		<h3>HOME TUITION</h3>
		<p>Receiving tuition at your home, at times that conveniently fit around your commitments, 
		is our primary undertaking. We have a range of professional tutors for every academic subject, who we are confident have 
		the qualities necessary to fulfill your tuition needs. After an initial conversation, 
		a Director will take a look at your individual requirements and start the selection process 
		for a well-suited tutor. If you’d like to know more about our tutors, or how we go about serving
		 our pupils, please read our about page. Alternatively, if you’d like to speak to us to arrange 
		 a tutor, please use the contact link below.

		 <h3>GROUP TUITION</h3>
		 <p> There are certain occasions where Group Tuition can be a suitable academic aid. 
		 These would include when pupils seem unable to connect with their current learning set-up, 
		 or perhaps if they are struggling to motivate themselves. Being part of regular group tuition 
		 can insulate pupils from the pressure of full-size school learning, while also allowing them 
		 to form new and positively reinforcing bonds with their new group classmates. We have found 
		 that the provision of Group Tuition is most effective when it is regular, for a pre-determined 
		 amount of time, and between pupils who are already known to each other. </p>
		 <p>If you think Group Tuition might suit your needs, please get in touch and we'll be 
		 happy to discuss a potential arrangement.</p>

		 <h3> TUITION AT OUR OFFICES </h1>
		 <p> At Bristol’s Brightest, we are fortunate in having access to office space in an ideal 
		 learning environment. If tuition outside of your home would suit you better, we’d be pleased 
		 to offer you this alternative space. Do mention this in your conversation with one of our staff. </p>
