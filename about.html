		<h3>THE BRISTOL'S BRIGHTEST ETHOS</h3>

		<p>Bristol’s Brightest has an ethos of putting our pupil’s academic study first. We like 
		to put significant research and time into finding a tutor whose abilities and circumstances 
		are well-matched to our pupils.  We are careful 
		to take into account every aspect of a smooth tuition 
		experience, some of which include: ensuring a teaching style suited to the pupil's personality and learning needs,
		tutors who are dedicated to a family for more than one year, and the tutor’s potential to cross-teach other subjects. 
		<br /> <br />
		The result of this well-proven system is that our pupils can get started with their tuition without 
		disrupting their current academic pursuits. They will receive well thought-out private tuition 
		that is suited to their learning style, considerate of their ambitions, and flexible with regards their other 
		extracurricular commitments. We have found that the provision of a consistent and reliable tuition 
		service is one of our distinguishing and most appreciated qualities. We are confident you will find this 
		with our services too. 
		</p>

		<h3>BRISTOL'S BRIGHTEST TUTORS</h3>
		<p>Being Bristol-based, we benefit from a broad pool of qualified candidates, which allows us to be discerning 
		in the process of sourcing our tutors. All of our tutors have recently graduated with degrees in a subject relevant
		 to those they teach. As recent graduates, our tutors are well-placed to provide up-to-date guidance on how to acheive 
		 your educational goals, whether that's at GCSE, A level, or university applications.
		   The vast majority of	our tutors have studied at The University of Bristol, but we also have graduates from 
		   Oxford, Cambridge and the other Russell Group universities. It is rare that we would use a tutor without a degree-level qualification, but exceptions are 
		 made in the cases of speciality tutors (for example those with a focus on dyslexic students).
		<br /> <br />
	    Our tutors hold our reputation in their hands, and as such we take a thorough approach to our vetting 
		 processes. We insist on personally interviewing each and every candidate. We are proud that our tutors 
		 manage to combine passion for their academic subjects with warm and engaging personalities.
	 	 <br />
		 <br />
		 We are able to apply for a CRB check on request and for peace of mind would recommend one.
